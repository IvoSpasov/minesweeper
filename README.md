# Minesweeper

This is a JavaScript version of the popular Microsoft Windows game Minesweeper. 

### Game Rules
The rules are the same as in the original game:

1. Uncover a mine, and the game ends.
2. Uncover an empty tile, and you keep playing.
3. Uncover a number, and it tells you how many mines lay hidden in the eight surrounding tiles. Information you use to deduce which nearby squares are safe to click.
4. Use left mouse click to see what is behind a tile and a right mouse click to mark a place of possible mine.
