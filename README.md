# Minesweeper

This is a Web version of the popular Windows game. 

The rules are the same as in the original game:
	Uncover a mine, and the game ends.
	Uncover an empty tile, and you keep playing.
	Uncover a number, and it tells you how many mines lay hidden in the eight surrounding tiles. Information you use to deduce which nearby squares are safe to click.
