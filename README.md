# Minesweeper

This is a JavaScript version of the popular Windows game Minesweeper. 

### Game Rules
The rules are the same as in the original game:

1. Uncover a mine, and the game ends.
2. Uncover an empty tile, and you keep playing.
3. Uncover a number, and it tells you how many mines lay hidden in the eight surrounding tiles. Information you use to deduce which nearby squares are safe to click.
